##  Implementation Example of MVC in Real Game Development
### Game Example: Battle Tank

#### Objective: Move the player tank across the map with the help of keyboard/touch inputs
Below we will show you how to make out tank move across the map with the help of MVC Implementation:

Before Jumping on to the game code example, We would like to revise the concepts of MVC via the below snippet:

Image

Letâ€™s Begin with the code implementation starting by writing the logic for the movement in Controller script,

### Controller
1. It will be responsible for storing the business logic for moving the tank
2. It will also contain the references of Model and View so that the program of the player tank can easily communicate with each other

Image

In the above we can observe the following:
1. Getter and Setter methods of Tank Model and Tank View script will be called in this script
2. The logic for moving and rotating the tank (to certain degrees) is given here.

### View
1. TankView will always be a MonoBehavior class.
2. This script will have all the details about all the visible components in our game system like tanks, bullets, enemies, random power Ups, collectables, etc.

Image

In the above we can observe the following:

1. Reference of Controller is given here
2. Tank movement logic which was defined in the controller and the same functions are called in the View scriptâ€™s FixedUpdate (for Physics Calculations) as it is the only class with MonoBehaviour

### Model
1. It will contain all the data variables that our Tank might need such as health, speed, colour, Turn speed of our Tank, etc.

Image

In the above we can observe the following:

1. Data components included that will be used by our PlayerTank
2. All the components are declared with a getter and setter here to be used in other scripts
