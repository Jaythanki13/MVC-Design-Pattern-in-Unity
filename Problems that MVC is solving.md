## Problems that MVC is solving
Without structure, your code can get messy very easily and look like “spaghetti code”. To avoid this, developers should separate the game logic from the display code

The MVC pattern helps you break up the frontend and backend code into separate components. Allows multiple game developers need to update, modify, or debug a full-blown application simultaneously.
