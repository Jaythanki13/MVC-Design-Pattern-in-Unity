## Advantages & Disadvantages of MVC pattern
Advantages are,

- Simultaneous development â€” Multiple developers can work simultaneously on the model, controller, and views.
- High Cohesion: MVC enables the logical grouping of related actions on a controller together. The views for a specific model are also grouped together.
- Low Coupling â€” The very nature of the MVC framework is such that there is low coupling among models, views, or controllers.
- Ease of modification â€” Because of the separation of responsibilities, future development or modification is easier i.e. scalability of the product is increased.
- Multiple views for a model â€” Models can have multiple views.

Disadvantages are,

- Code navigability â€” The framework navigation can be complex because it introduces new layers of abstraction and requires users to adapt to the decomposition criteria of MVC.
- Multiple Representations â€” Decomposing a feature into three artefacts causes scattering. Thus, requiring developers to maintain the consistency of multiple representations at once.
